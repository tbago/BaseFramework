 *  In iOS 5.0 and later, the system may delete the Caches directory on rare occasions when the system is very low on disk space. This will never occur while an app is running. However, be aware that restoring from backup is not necessarily the only condition under which the Caches directory can be erased.

A game might use this directory to store new levels purchased by the user and downloaded from a server.
 *  All content in this directory should be placed in a custom subdirectory whose name is that of your app’s bundle identifier or your company.
 *  In iOS, the contents of this directory are backed up by iTunes and iCloud.
